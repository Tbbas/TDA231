Further, we also assume that the probability of being in one of the two classes are equal, which is not the case here as only a small percentage of the population are considered rich (assuming \"rich\" is referring to money). Further, the method does in itself (as it does not explain the context) take into account that people might be unemployed (thus not being able to walk to work), or studying. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, to extend our approach, we need to calculate $p(x_{new} | t_{new} = k,X,t)$ by only calculating the percentage of persons belonging to one age group at a time. So instead of running the naive bayes approach on the entire dataset, we split it into three different experiments, based on the age group and run one experiment per age group, i.e. one experiment could have the labels rich/poor, and the attributes (under 20?, walk to work?). Then we somwhat compensate for the dependance of the age groups. \n",
